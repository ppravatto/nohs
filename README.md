The "Non-Orthogonal Hermite Solver" library (NOHS) is a simple C++ library that implements the solution of the eigenvalue problem associated with a one-dimensional quantum Hamiltonian. As the name implies, the library adopts a user-defined basis-set of non-orthogonal Hermite functions and applies the canonical orthogonalization procedure to ensure numerical stability.
